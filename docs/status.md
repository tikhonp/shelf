# Status

Phases 1 and 2 are done, and shelf runs in production on blackberry. [vision.md](vision.md) says what each phase brought and what may come next.

- **Downloads.** The web UI at `shelf.music.tikhonnnnn.com` and the bot `@music_shelf_bot` search and download from Qobuz, through qobuz-dl-go `v0.1.0`, and from Apple Music, through amdl and shelf-wrapper. Navidrome scans after downloads. shelf imported the old bot's 169 downloads.
- **Tags.** The Library tab edits every tag in the library, with suggestions, checks and fixes, covers, playback, history with undo, and bulk runs with ReplayGain and AcoustID. [tags.md](tags.md) describes it. `make contract` passes against Navidrome 0.64.2.

Every check in [manual-checklist.md](manual-checklist.md) passed in production, the last on 2026-11-05.

## Open

- Status's Library part doesn't say whether MusicBrainz answers, because the API has no such check.

## Remotes

| Repo | Origin | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| shelf | `ssh://git@code.tikhonnnnn.com/tikhon/shelf.git` | Forgejo. CI's image job pushes with the Actions secret `REGISTRY_TOKEN`, which has `write:package`. |
| qobuz-dl-go | `git@github.com:tikhonp/qobuz-dl-go.git` | GitHub only, public. CI runs on GitHub Actions. |

## Notes for later work

- In production the index holds 11,461 tracks and 1,008 Navidrome album IDs, the same as Navidrome. They form 1,013 albums, because 5 Navidrome albums span two folders each.
- A source module logs in and starts goroutines in `Run`, never in `Init`, and registers with `Switch` when its settings are missing.
- A wrapper signed in to the owner's Apple ID needs its own data folder and `--device-info`.
- Unset `SHELF_QOBUZ_TOKEN` for a local run with only the fake source, or it logs in to the owner's Qobuz account.
- Files in the music folder belong to UID 10001. Delete test downloads from inside the shelf container.
- Third, Portishead and Wish You Were Here 50 came from the checklist run, and the owner keeps them in the library.
